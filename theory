1. How would you explain docker's benefits to a colleague that has never heard of it? Include at least 2 benefits
- Platform independent: Docker containers are platform independent as these can run on any system
- Better Performance: It has better performance as it is independent of OS, these can be created quickly and faster to start

2. A colleague would like to build an application that consists of multiple services:

shopping-front (frontend for the shopping service)
shopping-back (backend for the shopping service)
shopping-db (database for the shopping service)

They are wondering if docker-compose would be useful in their deployment.
What is your opinion? Do you think they should use docker-compose for deployment,
or is it better to use the docker pull/run commands? Please explain reasoning behind decision.
- Using docker-compose will be helpful as it can handle all the services in one file, otherwise we need to run each service separately

3. Give a specific example/use-case of why you would add a docker volume to a container. What are volumes used for?
- We will add volumes to the container to make our application scalable by attaching same volume to multiple containers which can share data,
For example one docker container goes down we can attach same volume to another container with same data

4. From the following list, add either RUNTIME or BUILDTIME for the following elements:
(are they executed/used at runtime or build time?)

- docker run: RUNTIME
- docker build: BUILDTIME
- docker-compose up -d: RUNTIME
- Dockerfile: BUILDTIME
- docker logs -f <container_id>: RUNTIME
- publishing ports: RUNTIME
- pip install -r requirements.txt: BUILDTIME
- CMD flask run --host=0.0.0.0: RUNTIME

5. What is the difference between a host port and a container port? What is their relationship to each other?
- Container port will be the port on which app will be running, and docker host port will be the port
that will be published to users.
So container port will be mapped to host port which will allow user to access app via host port
