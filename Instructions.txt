===Exercises=== (60%)
Part 1
You start at a new company. They are going through a project of dockerizing all of their applications.
Your first task is to dockerize the payment-service application.
You can find the application here: https://github.com/neadan/payment-service.git
Note: the project is written in python 3.10

***For this part, ignore the docker-compose.yaml file***
Steps:
- Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/neadan/payment-service.git
- Create a new feature branch, call it feature/YOUR_NAME
   git checkout -b feature/YOUR_NAME
- Create your Dockerfile
- Build image
- Test your build by running the application and visiting the endpoint /api/v1/home
- Push your changes to your feature branch
  git add Dockerfile
  git push -u origin feature/YOUR_NAME

Part 2
You would like to add the following features to the project:
- A postgres database service (called payment-db) -- your payment-service must depend on payment-db
- A named volume called postgres-db for your payment-db service
- docker-compose.yaml file for deployment

Luckily, a colleague has helped you with by starting a docker-compose.yaml file, however he tells you that there
may be errors (sorry).

Steps:
- Enter the credentials for the postgres database AND service in the docker-compose file:
    POSTGRES_USER: myUser
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: myPassword
- Run the docker-compose file and try to debug the errors (hint there are 3) -- comment your changes in the docker-compose
- Make sure your payment-service depends on payment-db
- When services are up, try to visit the /api/v1/home endpoint
- Push your changes to your feature branch
  git add docker-compose.yaml
  git push

!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!
When you are done, copy the multiple_choice and theory files to the payment service repo you cloned in the Exercises section, and push the changes as well:
  git add multiple_choice
  git add theory
  git push
